This is a simple tool that allows you to merge multiple .cbz files into a single .cbz file.

## Usage

usage: comicmerge_cmd.py [-h] [-v] [-r start end] OUTPUT_FILE

Merge multiple cbz files into one.

positional arguments:
  OUTPUT_FILE           Name of the .cbz file to be created

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         More information as to the merging progress
  -r start end, --range start end
                        Specified by the format X-Y. Only the Xth to Yth comic
                        in the folder will be merged into the output file. If
                        multiple ranges are specified, OUTPUT_FILE will take
